Not setting default zone/region (this feature makes it easier to use
[gcloud compute] by setting an appropriate default value for the
--zone and --region flag).
See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute section on how to set
default compute region and zone manually. If you would like [gcloud init] to be
able to do this for you the next time you run it, make sure the
Compute Engine API is enabled for your project on the
https://console.developers.google.com/apis page.

WARNING: You might be using automatic scaling for a standard environment deployment, without providing a value for automatic_scaling.max_instances. Starting from March, 2025, App Engine sets the automatic scaling maximum instances default for standard environment deployments to 20. This change doesn't impact existing apps. To override the default, specify the new max_instances value in your app.yaml file, and deploy a new version or redeploy over an existing version. For details on max_instances, see https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/reference/app-yaml.md#scaling_elements.
